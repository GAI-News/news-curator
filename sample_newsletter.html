                    <p class="article-body">Elon Musk testified Monday he believed he had funding secured to take Tesla Inc. private, both from a Saudi Arabia investment fund and from his stake in SpaceX.

The Tesla chief executive resumed testimony in a federal trial in San Francisco over investor losses allegedly caused by tweets he fired off in 2018, including his “funding secured” tweet.

Representatives of Saudi Arabia’s investment fund “were unequivocal about moving forward,” Musk said. He also mentioned his large stake in privately held aerospace company SpaceX, and that “alone meant funding was secured.”

Tesla TSLA, +6.84% stock added to gains as Musk’s testimony got underway, and at last check was up nearly 8% and far outperforming the broader equity indexes.

The stock traded as high as $143.50, its highest intraday since Dec. 20, and was on pace to close at its best since that date.

The CEO told the court that the $420-a-share price on the deal “was a coincidence” as it was roughly a 20% premium over Tesla’s stock price at the time, and “not a joke.”

In certain circles, the number 420, pronounced four-20, refers to marijuana use.

Lead defense lawyer Nicholas Porritt also asked several questions that led Musk to say he hadn’t talked to major Tesla shareholders such as Baillie Gifford and T. Rowe Price about possibly taking Tesla private. Musk also said he couldn’t recall specifics around speaking with the board about the plan.

Firing off the now famous “funding secured” was a way to stay ahead of a soon-to-be-run Financial Times story about the Saudi fund taking a large stake at Tesla and as a way to keep all Tesla investors informed, Musk said. Moreover, he tweeted that he was “considering” the move, “not saying that it would be done,” Musk told the court.

Musk also said yes when asked whether he recalled friend and former Tesla board member Antonio Gracias asking him to pause before tweeting, and give the board notice before doing so.

Musk gave brief testimony Friday before the court adjourned for the day, taking pains to make clear that his tweets are not always taken to the letter. The trial started last week and it is expected to go into February.

“Just because I tweet something, it does not mean people believe it, or act accordingly,” Musk said on Friday to a defense attorney.

The trial revolves around Musk’s tweets from August 2018, including one where he told his millions of Twitter followers he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420” and then added “funding secured.” The plan later fizzled out.

Investor Glen Littleton, the lead plaintiff in the case, alleges he lost money due to the false tweets and is seeking damages.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen already has ruled that Musk’s tweets about taking Tesla private were not true and that Musk acted with recklessness.

It is still up to jurors to decide, however, if the tweets were material to investors and if the falsehoods caused investor losses.

The CEO and Tesla each were fined $20 million in September 2018 to settle civil charges around the “funding secured” tweets and Musk was stripped of his chairman role at Tesla.

Musk and Tesla agreed to settle the charges against them without admitting to nor denying the SEC’s allegations.

Musk’s bid to end the SEC settlement deal over the Tesla tweets was denied last year.</p>

                    <p class="article-body">Ken Griffin’s Citadel churned out a record $16 billion in profit for clients last year, outperforming the rest of the industry and one of history’s most successful financial plays.



The top 20 hedge fund firms collectively generated $22.4 billion in profit after fees, according to estimates by LCH Investments, a fund of .



Citadel’s gain was the largest annual return for a hedge fund manager, surpassing the $15 billion that John Paulson generated in 2007 on his bet against subprime mortgages. This was described as the “greatest trade ever” in a subsequent book of the same name by Gregory Zuckerman.



But it’s a different story outside the industry giants, with overall losing $208 billion last year as many managers found themselves on the wrong side of global market turmoil.



LCH estimated a return of 3.4 per cent at the top 20 managers — while the rest of funds it studied suffered losses of 8.2 per cent.



“The largest gains were once again made by the large multistrategy like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium,” LCH Chairman Rick Sopher said . “The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.”



The findings also reflect the growing clout of multistrategy hedge fund firms, which are on the cusp of taking over equity-focused funds to become the dominant strategy in the industry.



Their growing assets and higher fees are helping them win an expensive battle to hire and retain top traders.



LCH estimated that the industry has produced gains in excess of $1.4 trillion for clients since inception.



The top 20 managers, which oversaw almost 19 per cent of the industry assets, produced $692 billion of that profit, or 49 per cent of the total.</p>

                    <p class="article-body">CNN —

Microsoft on Monday confirmed it is making a “multibillion dollar” investment in OpenAI, the company behind the viral new AI chatbot tool called ChatGPT.

Microsoft, an early investor in OpenAI, said it plans to expand its existing partnership with the company as part of a greater effort to add more artificial intelligence to its suite of products. In a separate blog post, OpenAI said the multi-year investment will be used to “develop AI that is increasingly safe, useful, and powerful.”

“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, said in a statement.

The deepening partnership between the two companies has the potential to supercharge OpenAI’s ambitious projects, including ChatGPT, which has captured the attention of – and sometimes sparked concerns from – academics, business leaders and tech enthusiasts with its ability to create provide lengthy and thorough responses to user prompts and questions.

The investment could also catapult Microsoft as an AI leader and ultimately pave the way for the company to incorporate ChatGPT into some of its hallmark applications, such as Word, PowerPoint and Outlook.

As a result of its existing exclusive deal with OpenAI, Microsoft recently said it would soon add ChatGPT features to to its cloud computing service, Azure. If ChatGPT becomes available on that service, businesses could use the tools directly within its apps and services, too.

The investment comes days after Microsoft announced plans to lay off 10,000 employees as part of broader cost-cutting measures. Nadella said at the time that the company will continue to invest in “strategic areas for our future” and pointed to advances in AI as “the next major wave” of computing.

A bet on the future of AI

Since OpenAI opened up access to ChatGPT in late November, it has been used to write articles (with more than a couple factual inaccuracies) for at least one news publication; penned lyrics in the style of various artists (one of whom later responded, “this song sucks”) and drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists.

Some CEOs have also already used the platform to write emails or do some accounting work.

OpenAI is also the company behind DALL-E, which generates a seemingly limitless range of images in response to prompts from users. Both DALL-E and ChatGPT are trained on vast amounts of data in order to generate content.

But there are some risks for Microsoft and OpenAI here.

While these products have gained traction among users, they’ve also raised some concerns, including about their potential to perpetuate biases and spread misinformation. At the same time, a growing number of schools and teachers are concerned about the immediate impact of ChatGPT on students and their ability to cheat on assignments.

That could potentially create “much negative publicity” for the companies associated with these tools, said David Lobina, an artificial intelligence analyst at ABI Research.

The opportunity is immense, however, and could boost Microsoft’s position in the growing arms race over artificial intelligence, and provide a helpful boost to OpenAI in the process.

“OpenAI is looking to monetize their systems, considering the huge compute costs of creating these models,” Lobina told CNN ahead of the announcement Monday. “Their partnership with Microsoft can be an easy way to do so.”</p>

                    <p class="article-body">British households and businesses will be paid to cut their electricity use again as National Grid aims to reduce the strain on the energy network.

The electricity system operator (ESO) said on Monday it was looking for bids from suppliers to help save up to 341MW of power between 4.30pm and 6pm on Tuesday.

The plan, which could still be abandoned if conditions improve, would help balance supply and demand across Great Britain by encouraging consumers to cut their usage or shift it outside the time period.

We have taken this decision as we currently see a similar operational picture to the one available on Sunday. The use of these additional services is not an indication that electricity supplies are at risk, but that we require greater options to manage the network as normal. — National Grid ESO (@NationalGridESO) January 23, 2023

The “demand flexibility service” had only been used in trials before its first live use – during a “saving session” scheduled for between 5pm-6pm on Monday.

The scheme is only open to businesses and households with a smart meter whose supplier or aggregator is one of the 26 firms to have signed up.

More than 1m households and businesses have signed up to participate and most suppliers have closed the scheme to new participants. The household suppliers include British Gas, E.ON, Octopus Energy and EDF.

Under the initiative, a household’s power use will be compared with their normal usage for that time of day, and they will receive about £3 for every kilowatt hour saved.

Consumers could receive up to £6 depending on their supplier, meaning a household that normally uses their oven during an hour-long session could save up to £12 for not doing so and changing their use to either before or after the period, according to the consultancy firm LCP Delta.

The scheme was first trialled by Octopus Energy last year but took on more significance in the autumn when National Grid announced it was rolling out the service to more suppliers as part of its contingency plans to keep the lights on this winter.

A cut in Russian gas supplies after the invasion of Ukraine stoked concerns over gas supplies in Europe this winter, and the potential knock-on effect on Britain’s energy network.

National Grid had warned that a scenario in which a full cut to Russian supplies coincided with a cold snap could cause power cuts. However, the fears have largely receded as gas prices have fallen because of mild weather and strong storage levels in Europe.

As part of its contingency plans, National Grid also signed a series of deals to keep units on standby at coal-fired power stations that were due to be retired as Britain phased out the use of coal power.

To ensure supplies were available on Monday, National Grid asked Drax on Sunday to warm up two of its coal units at its North Yorkshire site and EDF to do the same with one its units at the West Burton plant in Nottinghamshire. It is understood those units were not called upon. However, the network operator said the units had been put on standby to produce power for Tuesday.

ESO data showed more than half of Britain’s energy generation was from gas-fired power plants on Monday, with 14% from wind generation and 12% from nuclear. Windfarm generation hit record highs last year but the use of gas also rose.

The periods of very elevated gas prices during the past year have fed through into higher consumer energy bills, raising concerns about the treatment of struggling households using prepayment meters in particular. The regulator Ofgem on Monday launched an investigation into energy suppliers’ treatment of prepayment customers.

Separately, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, Tony Danker, condemned the government’s failure to invest in the green economy, saying the UK is falling behind the US and EU.

In a speech at University College London on Monday, he said the US and Europe were “outspending and outsmarting us” on green growth. “While our competitors across Europe, Asia and the US are making their move, and going hell for leather, we seem to be second guessing ourselves and hoping for the best,” he said.</p>

                    <p class="article-body">Berlin Reuters —

Ford plans to cut 3,200 jobs across Europe and move some product development work to the United States, Germany’s IG Metall union said on Monday, vowing action that would disrupt the carmaker across the continent if the cuts go ahead.

Ford (F) wants to axe 2,500 jobs in product development and a further 700 in administrative roles, with German locations most affected, IG Metall said.

Workers at the US carmaker’s Cologne site, which employs around 14,000 people — including 3,800 working at a development center in the neighborhood of Merkenich — were informed at works council meetings on Monday of the plans.

Ford declined to comment, referring to a statement on Friday in which it said that shifting to electric vehicle production required structural changes but that it would not say more until plans were finalized.

The company announced last year a $2 billion investment in expanding production at its Cologne plant — which currently produces the Ford Fiesta as well as engines and transmissions — to make a mass-market all-electric model.

Ford is planning seven new electric models in Europe, a battery-assembly site in Germany and a nickel cell manufacturing joint venture in Turkey as part of a major electric vehicle (EV) push on the continent.

It also has a partnership with Volkswagen (VLKAF) to produce 1.2 million vehicles on the German carmaker’s MEB electric platform over six years.

But it warned in June last year of “significant” job cuts to come in the near term at its factory in Spain and its plant in Saarlouis, Germany, as the shift to EV production meant it would require fewer labor hours to assemble cars.

Ford of Europe produces, sells and services Ford brand vehicles in 50 markets, employing around 45,000 people at its own facilities and consolidated joint ventures, according to its website.

“If negotiations between the works council and management in coming weeks do not ensure the future of workers, we will join the process. We will not hold back from measures that could seriously impact the company not just in Germany but Europe-wide,” IG Metall said.</p>

                    <p class="article-body">Several banks are reportedly working on a digital wallet that links with debit and credit cards, in a bid to compete with Apple Pay and PayPal.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the digital wallet would be operated by Early Warning Services, a joint venture from several banks that also runs Zelle. The major banks involved include Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America , according to the report.

The new wallet would initially be launched with Visa and Mastercard already on board, according to the report.

Early Warning Services confirmed to CNBC that it plans to launch a wallet product this year.

The move could be seen as an effort to slow Apple &#39;s push into consumer banking, as the tech giant already offers a branded credit card and is exploring other products for their famously loyal customer base.

Shares of PayPal, which has digital payments as its core business, were little changed on Monday after initially falling more than 2%.

Bernstein analyst Harshita Rawat said in a note to clients on Monday that the major banks have &#34;likely always had PayPal envy&#34; but that it would take time for the new wallet to be a serious risk to incumbents.

&#34;It simply takes a very long time, a killer customer experience (which needs to be better than incumbents, not just similar), and a compelling merchant value proposition to build the two-sided network effects in payments to achieve scale,&#34; Rawat said in the note.

The report follows a mixed earnings season for big banks, with several CEOs, including Bank of America&#39;s Brian Moynihan, warning that the U.S. is likely to see a mild recession. Bank stocks have struggled over the past year even as interest rates have risen, as fears of a recession and a slower investment banking environment have offset gains in net interest income.
